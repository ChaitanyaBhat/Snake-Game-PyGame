# Snake Game

This game is developed using Python PyGame.

Screenshot of this game is attached below:

A snake is trying to eat the frog. Each time when the snake eats the frog, its length increases by one unit. Accordingly gamers score will increase. The current score is displayed on the top left corner of the screen.

Up, Down, Left and Right arrow keys are used to move the snake. Each time the frog appears in different positions on the application screen. 

If the snake fails to turn and touches the wall of the app screen, the game will terminate.
